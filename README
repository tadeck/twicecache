 Twice

* This needs a lot of work

Introduction

	Twice was designed to solve some of the most challenging problems faced
while trying to scale a web application.  It is written in Python using the
Twisted networking framework.  Twisted uses a single-threaded, asynchronous
model, so it's good at handling high concurrency situations.

Architecture

	Twice is a reverse-proxying webserver with an in-memory cache and basic
templating language.  It serves each incoming request using its cache when 
possible.  Otherwise, requests are passed on to the backend servers.  The
response is then cached for a finite amount of time.  When the cache expires, 
it will be refreshed lazily when a new request for that particular page 
arrives.
